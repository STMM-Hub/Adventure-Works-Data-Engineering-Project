# Adventure-Works-Data-Engineering-Project
Adventure Works Data Engineering Pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks and Power BI

## Introduction
The **Adventure Works Data Engineering Project** is an end-to-end data pipeline solution built using modern Azure tools. It ingests data from HTTP sources via **Azure Data Factory**, transforms it using **Azure Databricks**, and stores the processed data in **Azure Synapse Analytics**. The final datasets are visualized through **Power BI** dashboards, enabling insightful business reporting and analysis.
